# Go4Lunch <br />
The Go4Lunch will be a collaborative application used by all employees. It will allow you to find restaurants near you and to share your restaurant choice with coworkers. You'll also be able to check out where your coworkers are headed for lunch and decide if you want to go with them. Just before the lunch break, the app will notify different employees and invite them to join their coworkers.
